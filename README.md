## Bayesian Inference
The first notebook solves an exercise on Bayesian Inference. The problem is: given prior distribution of some propability value and the outcome of the experiment, calculate the posterior distribution, and find 95% central confidence interval.

## Travelling Salesman Problem with Simulated Annealing
The second notebook solves travelling salesman problem on 30 most populous cities in Russia using simulated annealing approach to optimization. The solution depends on data which is not included in the repository: [dataset of cities of Russia](https://github.com/hflabs/city) and the [country outline](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sadvwkzbqjjurdv/russia.json?dl=1)
